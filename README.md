## Creating Components

Use the "Folder Templates" extension to create a new component template.
To create a new component right click on a folder, select "Create New Templated Folder", write the component's name and press enter when finished.

### Component Template

Creates a template of a React Component

### Storybook Component Template

Creates a template of a React Component with a corresponding Storybook story

## Styling

TailwindCSS should be able to cover most to all styling needs. In a case where a custom css class is needed and will be reusable, create the new class on "index.css" on the "@layer utilities". For component specific styling, create a new css file (format: "component-name.module.css") in the component's corresponding folder and import it.
